# Tournament Scheduler
Creates excel/word documents for single round robin badminton tournaments for up to 10 duo teams per court.
A scheduling algorithm makes the games equally spaced out so that the largest possible number of duos have equal resting times.           
200+ players compete in these tournaments which are hosted by KBFS America (http://kbfsa.com/).
I utilized the Apache POI API and Java Swing API for this project.
